# Switching Switch App dev tutorial

This project will serve as a step-by-step onos-p4 development tutorial extended from the template app tutorial provided in the official onos wiki. 
Hopefully, I'd like to summarize the basic how-to with sufficient relevant details required to make an p4/app such as 

0) how to setup an onos dev environment
_1) how to add a CLI command to a custom onos app_ *
_2) how to add a custom netcfg parameter to a device registered to onos_ *
3) how to implement a custom protocol 

not all the elements in this list are implemented yet (implemented ones will be marked with *) 
and this list itself is neither completed
